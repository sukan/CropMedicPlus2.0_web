## Project Description

The soil composition around the world is depleting at a rapid rate due to overexploitation by the unsustainable use of fertilizers. Streamlining the availability of nutrient deficiency and fertilizer related knowledge among impoverished farming communities would promoter environmentally and scientifically sustainable farming practices. Thus, contributing to several Sustainable Development Goals set out by the United Nations. The most direct solution to the inappropriate fertilizer usage is to add only the necessary amounts of fertilizer required by plants to produce a significant yield without nutrition deficiencies. To this end this paper proposes a Smart Nutrient Disorder Identification system employing computer vision and machine learning techniques for identification purposes and a decentralized blockchain platform to streamline a bias-less procurement system. The proposed system yielded 88% accuracy in disorder identification, while also enabling secure, transparent flow of verified information. 


## Main Objective of Research: 

Provide an intelligent solution capable of identifying the nutrition deficiencies in plants, the extent of the nutrition deficiency and recommend the suitable remedy through 
soil analysis in an agriculture researcher verified system.

## Individual Objectives of Research:

1. IT17110808 - M.Sukanya
     - Accurate identification of nutrition deficiency (amongst N, P and K) (The specific objective of this component is to identify the nutrient deficiency in a plant with speed and accuracy using image processing technique and CNN)


2. IT17109840 - L.H. Rajaratne
     - Identification of the degree of nutrition deficiency and recommendation of suitable remedy (The primary objective of this component is to identify the degree of the disorder. Secondly, this component aims in using the results obtained from component 3, to recommend the suitable remedy in terms of the application of chemical fertilizer etc.)


3. IT15070418 - K.T. Ramasinghe
     - Soil analysis using IoT to provide accurate degree of nutrition deficiency in soil and recommendation (The main expectation of this component is to develop a fully functionally IOT device to measure Nutrient levels (NPK),Organic Matters, EC Conductivity, pH level of selected soil crop and creating inputs for Machine learning algorithm which is created by member 2)


4. IT17354516 - B.I Sariffodeen
     - mplement a secure and distributed platform for identifying best commercial product for deficiency based on diagnosis (The primary objective of this component is to identify the most suitable methodology to implement a distributed platform to provide farmer – vendor – agricultural researcher engagement while over coming information asymmetry)


## Main Research Question:

Investigating best technological procedures to accurately detect and verify a plant nutrient deficiency with specific degree and recommend most adequate solutions based on degree 
of identified deficiency.

### Identified Individual Research Questions:

- Investigating the best machine learning and image processing techniques to be used to select for identification of the nutrition disorder and its degree.

- Investigating the plant nutrition deficiency symptoms and the relevant magnitude of nutrient deficiency in soil.

- Investigating the best method to be used to set up a control experiment to analyse the above variations.

- Investigating the use of Arduino in assessing soil composition.

- Investigating the most practical method to be used to vary soil composition and obtain a usable measure to analyse and use the data on soil composition.

- Investigating the use of block-chain technologies in creating a system for the interaction of stakeholders.

- Investigating the attitudinal manners in promoting this system to be used by the stakeholders. 

### Individual Research Problems:

- The inability to detect a plant with a particular nutrition deficiency specifically amongst a number of deficiencies based on symptoms appearing on the leaf. The inability to detect nutrition deficiencies in this manner amongst a variety of plants subsequently is the first main research problem identified.

- The inability to detect the degree of a plant identified to contain nutrition deficiency accurately and analyse the reason for such a deficiency using several variables. The inability to carry out the above function and recommend a suitable remedy for the deficiency are all part of this same research problem.

- The inability to measure and analyse the soil composition data by means of an IoT device that is practically usable in the field. The unavailability of a solution to provide these values to be used for further analysis on the amount of fertilizer required in a short time with a significant accuracy.

- The inability to provide farmers with verified information by researches on the best fertilizer to be used at a given time without being influenced by the vendors.
